## Description



### Example Data

The example data we used is a Kaggle dataset containing information from Hong Kong throughbred races from 6/1/1997 - 08/27/2005 (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gdaley/hkracing). In particular we are looking at the runs.csv file which contains information from specific horse runs in each race, including features such as the horse's country of origin, breed, age, etc... 



## Contents

Our data/raw folder contains the .csv files from the original Kaggle dataset. We are mainly focused on runs.csv which contains information about individual horse performances in the Hong Kong races. 


The scripts folder contains our preprocessing scripts for reading and cleaning the data, exploratory data analysis, and models to predict whether a horse is a winner or not.
