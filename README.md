## Description

### Example Data

The example data we used is a Kaggle dataset containing information from Hong Kong throughbred races from 6/1/1997 - 08/27/2005 (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gdaley/hkracing). In particular we are looking at the runs.csv file which contains information from specific horse runs in each race, including features such as the horse's country of origin, breed, age, etc... 



## Contents

Our data/raw folder contains the .csv files from the original Kaggle dataset. We are mainly focused on runs.csv which contains information about individual horse performances in the Hong Kong races.
